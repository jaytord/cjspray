cc,"What Graco Reactor is right for you depends on your application and plan. There are two main categories of Reactors: Foam and Coatings. They are both similar and do the same thing, but coating proportioners are capable of higher pressures to atomize heavier coatings. The additional pressure requires more horsepower, so Reactors for coatings cost more than Reactors for foam. <br />	<br />Within those two categories we also have three types of Reactors: Air, Electric, and Hydraulic, which refers to how the pumps are driven. Air operated Reactors use an air motor to drive the pump lowers which requires a large air compressor that makes them uncommon in mobile rig applications. Electric Reactors are a great balance of performance and price and have quickly become the most popular in the market place. Hydraulic Reactors have great durability and can have higher outputs than the electric series Reactors. Along with the hydraulics comes a higher price tag.",info/3_reactors.jpg

ee,"Strongly recommend purchasing two identical spray guns. Choose which gun is best for you, but then buy TWO. When spraying products that set-up in seconds have a second gun is a must.

ii,"CJ Spray configured rigs use generators and will only make shore power rigs after personal consulation. Generators increase production, provide clean power to Reactors, and reduce personal interaction with dangerous electrical power. The right generator depends on the power required by the equipment in the spray rig. There are two major electrical components in each rig: the Reactor and the air compressor. <br /><br />Reactors have electric motors and very large electric heaters that can draw a lot of power. Electric air compressors also draw a lot of power, especially at start up. We set all of our compressors to run continuously so they do not turn on or off, which provides cleaner and more consistent power to the Reactor. The generator should still be sized to handle the initiall start-up of the compressor. There are also other electrical demands inside the trailer that add up such as compressed air driers, heater, lights, grinders, and air conditioners. To properly size the generator add up the electrical requirements and provide a 25% cushion. In most applications the E20 Reactor requires a 20 kW generator and everything larger.",info/40_kW_Gen.jpg
ii-1,"Gas operated generators are low cost, but do not provide long lasting durability. They also have low power output making them limited to E-20 and A-20 Reactors. The gas generator is only available in the 16 ft trailer and is mounted in the “dog house” on our EZ slide system.",info/17_5_kw_gas_generator.jpg
ii-2,"Small diesel powered generator is powerful, durable, and compact; making it capable of fitting in the “dog house” of the 16 ft trailer. Upgrading from the gas generator to this diesel will add years of trouble free performance and reliability.",info/20_kW_Diesel.jpg
ii-3,John Deere powered diesel generator provides enough power for any Graco Reactor. Has optional screw compressor (see air compressor section next) that mounts directly to generator saving space and power draw.,info/40_kW_Gen.jpg
j,"Like sizing a generator, the right compressor will be dependent on the air requirement (scfm) of the tools you use. Mobile spray rigs use several pieces of air operated equipment, all of which put a demand on the air compressor. The drum pumps, spray guns, agitators (optional), and fresh air supply systems (optional) all require compressed air. Other tools in your trade may also require compressed air. For example scarfers used in the foam industry can require up to 30 scfm of air. Another consideration is space and weight. <br /><br />CJ Spray offers two types of compressors: electric driven piston compressors and a belt driven screw compressor mounted on the generator. Electric compressors are cost effective and are available on vertical or horizontal mounted tanks. Verticle tanks are used in our 16 ft, 20 ft, and box truck models, and the horizontal tanks are mounted above the cab over of our gooseneck trailers. Our screw compressor option is mounted on our 40 kW generator and runs directly off the diesel engine, so there is no electrical requirement. In most applications a tank is not required saving value weight and space making the screw compressor a great option for 20 ft bumper pull trailers.",info/PC030198.jpg
